## **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatnet.git
   cd chatnet

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
DB = "postgresql"
DB_NAME = "your_db_name"
DB_USERNAME = "your_db_username"
DB_PASSWORD = "your_db_password"
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = 5432
TEST_DB_PORT = 5432
REDIS_HOST = "localhost"
REDIS_PORT = 6379
REDIS_DB = "0"
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 43200
OTP_EMAIL = "your_email@example.com"
OTP_PASSWORD = "your_email_password"
```


## Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Database Migrations

Apply the database migrations to set up your schema:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Start the Server

Run the server locally with the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Access the API Documentation

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation.


# Dockerized Setup
## Build and Start the Containers

If you prefer a Dockerized setup, use the following command to build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access the Application

Once the containers are running, the API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.


# Testing

Run the test suite to validate the functionality:

```bash
pytest
```


# CI/CD Pipeline

1. The CI/CD pipeline automates the following tasks:

    Running tests with every commit.
    Building Docker images.
    Deploying updates to the production server.

2. Ensure you configure your CI/CD service (e.g., GitHub Actions) with the correct environment secrets.

# Roadmap

Here are some upcoming features and improvements:

    Add WebSocket support for real-time messaging.
    Implement machine learning models for feed recommendations.
    Support Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
    Extend search capabilities with Elasticsearch.
